Title: Day 13

Agenda:

We'll start with small-group presentations for (resource: project-1.pdf page: files/project-1 text: Project 1). I'll distribute some simple grading cards so that your classmates can evaluate how you speak about your work.

I hope everyone can have good conversations about the tribulations of building your first website!

It should be said: six weeks ago, many of you hadn't written a single line of code, and today, you're showing off an entirely custom website. _Nice work_.
