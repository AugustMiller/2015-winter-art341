Agenda:

Half way! Let's take the day to do one-on-one check-ins regarding Project 1 visual design. Please note that the deadline has been extended to Friday, February 6.

Regardless, I'd like to see some evidence of progress and visual thinking that reflects your topic, attributes and wireframes.

I'll be noting common visual treatments and will use the remainder of class to demonstrate how we might translate them into code.
