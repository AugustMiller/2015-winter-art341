Agenda:

Look out! This is going to be a busy week. There will be a lot of time required outside of class to meet some pretty aggressive deadlines on (resource: project-1.pdf page: files/project-1 text: Project 1).

Today will be primarily one-on-one check-ins on Project 1 progress. I'll run through the class list alphabetically, after offering a first round of sign-ups for anyone eager to discuss their designs.

Checklist:
- Two *Content Outlines* showing different organizational conceits for (resource: project-1.pdf page: files/project-1 text: Project 1).
- Two unique sets of wireframes representing your *Content Outlines'* organization, and demonstrating cursory spatial exploration. For both conceits, a wireframe for the homepage and detail page's structure is required.
- Two rough design directions showing basic appearance of the page. Fonts, image style, etc. are a good way to start.
