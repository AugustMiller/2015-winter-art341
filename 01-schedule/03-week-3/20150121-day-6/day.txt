Title: Day 6

Agenda:
Today will be mostly devoted to one-on-one Project 1 check-ins. Everyone will be responsible for rationalizing their topics and documenting their process up to this point.

Have your computers, sketchbooks or notepads ready! I'd like to see how you've represented your thinking. While you're waiting, continue with (link: assignments/codecademy text: Codecademy) and wrap up your work on the Blog Styling exercise from last week.

The remainder of time will be used to start talking about layout with CSS. Codecademy will have introduced this concept in the _CSS Positioning_ lesson.

Checklist:
- Be ready for your one-on-one check-in.
- Share your Project 1 topic in `#projects` on Slack! It'll be nice for everyone to see the variety
