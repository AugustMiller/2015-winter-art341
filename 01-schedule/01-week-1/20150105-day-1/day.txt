Title: Day 1

Agenda:
Let's get started by sharing our favorite websites and software. This might mean a social network, media service, news site or an app on your phone. What makes a compelling screen experience? Post these to our (link: https://psudesign.slack.com/messages/links/ text: Slack channel) so we can dive right in!

We'll talk broadly about audience, intent, results, technology and process for each, and how each relates to our objectives this term.

Time permitting, we'll make a quick pass over the typical process for a typical web or software project, in the real world.
