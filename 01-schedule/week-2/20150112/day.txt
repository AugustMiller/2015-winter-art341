Agenda:
Last week, we learned about ways to express complex, structured, hierarchical information with just text. We walked through Markdown, YAML, XML and HTML, and took a peek at CSS.

Today, we'll take a closer look at the (resource: html-cheatsheet.pdf page: resources text: syntax of HTML), and learn about some special HTML tags and their typical attributes. This document will be available on the (link: resources text: Resources) page for your reference, indefinitely.
