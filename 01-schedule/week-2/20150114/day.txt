Title: Day 4

Agenda:
Today will be primarily about CSS.

After setting up a nice, clean (resource: starter-project.zip page: resources text: project directory), we'll go through a series of exercies to get us familiarized with different CSS selectors and properties.

Once we have a baseline understanding of the CSS *cascade*, we'll learn a technique called *floating* and start to do some more sophisticated layouts.
