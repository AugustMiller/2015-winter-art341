Agenda:

We'll start the day by talking about Codecademy and the (resource: assignment-codecademy.pdf page: resources text: expectations for work done therein).

In preparation of for the work due Monday, we'll run through an example of wireframes and content outlines.

Building on our two-column demo from (link: #day-5 text: Monday), we'll continue to build sophsticated layouts using the CSS `float`, `position` and `clear` properties.

We'll move on to some other special effects that leverage CSS3 to create rich visual interfaces, without raster graphics.
