Title: Day 7

Agenda:

Let's take a different approach to Project 1. A number of objectives weren't clear at the outset, so to make sure everyone is on board, we'll look at some examples of past projects, and discuss why they were successful.

We'll briefly talk about wireframes, and how our planning work will transition into design and development.

In the second half of class, we'll go over the project folder again (while discussing relative and absolute URLs), and take a closer look at CSS Floats.
