Title: Sublime Text
----
Description:
Sublime Text is a minimal but incredibly powerful text editor. It has the right balance of utility and user-friendliness to be a great match for first-time coders and seasoned hackers alike.

I highly reccommend picking up a licenseâ€” we'll live and breathe text in this course (and 342!), so it's a great investment. Having used it almost daily for three or four years, I can confidently say it's the best piece of software I've ever purchased.
