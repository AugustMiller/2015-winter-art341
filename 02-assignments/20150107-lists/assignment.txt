#### Intent
Some HTML tags have special meaning. It's important to use them _semantically_, whenever possible. Semantic HTML is a practice that involves using appropriately named tags (like `em` for "emphasis" or `h1` for an important headline)

#### Lists
Let's use the `ul` and `ol` tags to build simple lists of content.

Typically, an _unordered list_ tags (`ul`) are used to relate similar, unsequenced items. _Ordered List_ tags (`ol`) are used when the sequence of their items is important, like instructions. Both types of lists use the _list item_ tag (`li`) to mark the beginning and end of each item.

Take a look at this HTML for an unordered list of fruit:

    <ul>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Raspberry</li>
      <li>Banana</li>
    </ul>

And this, of an ordered list of instructions for how to make fruit salad:

    <ol>
      <li>Slice fruit, avoiding seeds and pits</li>
      <li>Combine in a large mixing bowl</li>
      <li>Add 1/4 cup fruit juice</li>
      <li>Toss</li>
    </ol>

Pretty similar, right? Let's see how the unordered list appears in the browser:

- Apple
- Raspberry
- Banana

Now, the ordered list. Notice the numbers that the browser adds:

1. Slice fruit, avoiding seeds and pits
2. Combine in a large mixing bowl
3. Add 1/4 cup fruit juice
3. Toss

#### Expectations

It's time for you to build your own lists. By Wednesday, turn in a single HTML file containing two labeled lists to your Google Drive folder.
